### Project Overview

 The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this project, I will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) , look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better understanding of data handling with python(pandas). In this project, I applied following concepts :

- Dataframe Operations

- Conditional Statement and Loops

- List Operations

- Bar Plotting

- Mathematical Operations 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Calculate values using group by, indexing, slicing and creating new dataframe 

Plot the calculated values to get a visuals of data
